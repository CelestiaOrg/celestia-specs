## Preamble

Tendermint provides finality under an honest 2/3 of voting power assumption. It is one of several ["BFT" consensus protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938) (also known as "classical" consensus protocols). Under that assumption, new _valid_ blocks are immediately and forever final as soon as 2/3 of voting power commits to the block. Therefore, under that assumption, Tendermint is fork-free.

Contemporary blockchains support full nodes (which are secure under no assumption on voting power honesty) and light nodes (which are secure under an honest majority of voting power assumption). LazyLedger is unique in [supporting light nodes with stronger security guarantees](../specs/node_types.md#node-type-definitions):

1. full nodes are secure under no assumptions on voting power honesty
1. light nodes (and partial nodes) are secure under [an honest minority of nodes and synchronous communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044), and no assumptions on voting power honesty
1. superlight nodes are secure under an honest majority of voting assumption

Note that _secure_ in this context is defined as "not accepting invalid blocks," and is orthogonal to _consensus safety_. The introduction of light nodes that do not depend on an honest majority assumption also introduces additional cases that must be analyzed.

## Invalid vs Unavailable

Tendermint (and other consensus protocols) requires blocks to be _valid_, i.e. pass a [validity predicate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938) before they are accepted by an honest node. Note that both validity and invalidity are deterministic and monotonic, i.e. that once a block is valid or invalid, it will be valid or invalid for all future time.

With [Data Availability Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044) (DAS), there is a notion of _available_ and _unavailable_ blocks. Both are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Availability is assumed monotonic (i.e. once a block is available, it will remain available since The Internet Never Forgets), but unavailability is not. A block proposer may hide a block to make currently-online nodes see the block as unavailable, then reveal the entire (valid) block at a later time.

## Scenarios

We consider two scenarios.

**A dishonest majority hide a committed block, commit to a second block at the same height within the weak subjectivity window to fork the chain, then reveal the first block**. This is trivially equivocation and requires social consensus to resolve which fork to accept. The unavailability of the first block is orthogonal. Nodes that detect equivocation by a majority of voting power within the weak subjectivity window must halt regardless.

**A dishonest majority hide a committed block, commit additional blocks on top of it, then reveal the first block within the weak subjectivity window**. There is no equivocation. Note that a node cannot distinguish a dishonest majority in this scenario from a transient network failure on their end and an honest majority.

A requirement is that full nodes and light nodes agree on the same head of the chain automatically in this case, i.e. without human intervention.

Light nodes follow consensus state (i.e. validator set changes and commits) and perform DAS. If a block is seen as unavailable but has a commit, DAS is performed on the block continuously until either DAS passes, or the weak subjectivity window is exceeded at which point the node halts.

Full nodes fully download and execute blocks. If a block is seen as unavailable but has a commit, full downloading is re-attempted continuously until either it succeeds, or the weak subjectivity window is exceeded at which point the node halts.

Under [an honest minority of nodes and synchronous communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09044) assumptions, passing DAS probabilistically guarantees the block can be fully downloaded. Therefore, the above protocol guarantees light nodes and full nodes will agree on the same head automatically without manual intervention, under a synchrony assumption equal to the unbonding window (formal proof pending).

> Note: whether re-downloading/re-sampling is attempted at a fixed interval or on receipt of a new block header with a Tendermint commit is an implementation detail.

> Note: users may wish to set a much shorter timeout than the unbonding window before they are notified of their node being unable to verify the availability of a committed block. This does not affect the properties analyzed above, but may result in more manual attention in the event of intermittent network disruptions.
